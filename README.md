# 🌍 CO₂ Emissions EDA (2024) with MySQL

##
This EDA provides data-driven insights into emission trends, helping policymakers, industries, and researchers strategize for a more sustainable future. 🌱🌍♻️

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes **global CO₂ emissions for 2024** using **MySQL**. The analysis covers **total emissions, sector-wise and country-wise trends, monthly emission trends**, and compares findings with **2023 data from external sources** to identify key differences.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **2024 Data:** Used a near-real-time dataset containing global CO₂ emissions data across different sectors and regions around the world from carbonmonitor.org .
- **2023 Data:** Used for comparison, sourced from external reports .  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **Data cleaning**  
- **Data Analysis & Aggregation**  
- **Comparative Analysis**  

## 🔍 Key Analysis & Queries  

- **Total CO₂ emissions for 2024**  
- **Top emitting countries & sectors**  
- **Sector-wise distribution of emissions**  
- **Comparison with 2023 data**  
- **Trends & year-over-year changes**  

## 📈 Findings  

- The total CO₂ emissions in **2024 were 38,013.13 MtCO₂**, slightly higher than **37,400 MtCO₂ in 2023**.  
- **China, ROW, and the U.S.** were the top three emitters in 2024.  
- The **Power and Industry** sectors contributed the most to emissions.  
- Some sectors and countries saw a decline in emissions compared to 2023, indicating potential shifts in energy usage or policy impacts.  

## 📌 Conclusion  

This analysis of **2024 CO₂ emissions** provided key insights into global emission patterns, sectoral contributions, and country-wise trends. The total emissions in **2024 (38,013.13 MtCO₂)** showed a slight **increase from 2023 (37,400 MtCO₂)**.  

- **China, ROW, and the U.S.** remained the top emitters, with power and industry sectors contributing the most.  
- Some countries and sectors experienced a decline, possibly due to policy changes, energy transitions, or economic shifts.
